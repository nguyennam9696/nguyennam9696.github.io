      <h2>Let's have a class in "Classes for Ruby"</h2>
      <h3>What is a Class?</h3>
      <p>A class is very useful and a powerful tool to be used in Ruby language. What a class does is define what an object is and define what an object can do. It is like the teacher of the classroom controlling all of the teacher's minions. A Class is always has capitalization of the first word with camel-cases there after.</p>

      <h3>Classes will do . . ?</h3>
      <p>Classes will group the code into discrete and well-categorized areas and make codes much easier to work with. Let's create a class called Animal. You begin by activating the object because Ruby is an object-oriented language and almost everything is an object. You activate the object by creating a NEW object from the class. Look below for an example.</p>
      <p>After you activate the new object, you then assign this to a variable animal. And like we said before, everything in the class, the class has control over. You just have to call the object that was so neatly tucked inside the Class.</p>
      <h3>Instance Variables</h3>
      <p>Instance Variables have an "@" symbol before the variable name. This acts as an object created from the class, so that we can tell this object what to do and provide it functionality. Just like a application form, the forms all look the same, it just matters of HOW you fill out the form. That is the same as instance variable. The only downside to using the instance variable is that it cannot be called from the outside. It can only be called within the method. Luckily, we have a attribute method: reader, writer, and accessor to get and set the variable.</p>
