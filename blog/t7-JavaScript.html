      <h2>The Tales of Two Languages: Javascript vs. Ruby</h2>
      <h3>A little "Tale" snippet . . . </h3>
        <p>I have departed onto my quest to learn the school of two thoughts. I slowed down on this forked path and thought to myself what most coders would also think, "Which path is better?" Now, this perspective is taken from a beginner coder. Take it with a grain of salt, but if you are like me and had just began your journey as well, you can listen in on this. Beginner coders, let's rejoice because there is a language for us to easily learn, super readable as if it was an English Book, and most importantly, it's the color Red (my favorite color). Below are the lists of reasons why I love Ruby over Javascript.</p>
      <h3>The path I have chosen: <b>"RUBY"</b></h3>
      <h4>1) JS: Triple (===) vs Ruby: Double (==)</h4>
        <p>I was wondering why JS is skipping over the double equal sign and instead require a triple equal sign for checking if something is equal to something. Not to be confused with Ruby, 1 (=) sign means equal and 2 (==) sign is the same as the (===) in JS. Ruby makes it neater and shorter. Score +1 for me.</p>
      <h4>2) JS: Tons of Semicolons &amp; Tons of Hashes vs Ruby: def &amp; end</h4>
        <p>NEVER EVER, EVER again will you get an error in Ruby for missing a semicolon again! Let's all rejoice for a second at how we as programmers just killed a huge <b>bug</b> out of our lives. Each time you define a function in JS, you have to wrap the whole block code in hashes. For ruby, you just have to write a simple <code>def</code> for "define" and <code>end</code> for "end" of code block.</p>

        <img src="Screen Shot 2015-03-27 at 8.04.55 PM.png" alt="Javascript" width="1044px">
        <p>Notice another thing. Ruby <code>puts</code> for "put string" which will output a string vs Javascript <code>console.log();</code> for logging into the console. Which one is better for you? :) I know who is the clear winner here.</p>
      <h4>3) JS Long Iteration vs Ruby Short Iteration through an Array</h4>
        <p>Notice below that the <code>each</code> method in Ruby vs the <code>forEach</code> method in Javascript. Take your choice. </p>

        <img src="Screen Shot 2015-03-27 at 8.14.42 PM.png" alt="Javascript" width="1044px">
      <h4>4) Syntax Difference</h4>
        <p>If you guys are curious at the detailed syntactical codes, check out this great <a href="http://agentcooper.github.io/js-ruby-comparison/">website</a>.</p>
      <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>With that being said, there are a lot of similarities between Javascript and Ruby mainly both are Object Oriented Programming (OOP) languages, but that is not what this blog is about. That is another story for another day. . . I hope you liked the brief overview of some of the major differences I have seen. There are certainly a ton more, but for a beginner coder, this is gist of it for you to decide a little bit more what languages you want to dive into. Hope you had a good read, take care everyone.</p>
