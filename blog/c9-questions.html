      <h2>5 Best Tips for Asking Good Questions</h2>
      <blockquote>"All men are created equal."<br>Thomas Jefferson</blockquote>
      <p>Nope. Some are born more intelligent than others. However, it doesn't mean that all genuises will flourish and all the lessers will die off.
      Think about why it is hard for you to ask questions in class, in your work place or just in any general settings? The only requirement for this is, be honest with yourself.
      <br>I believe we are amongst the same because I too had to struggle getting past that stage of humility in order to get my knowledge. After you finish asking yourself that question,
      come see if these tips resonates with what you are experiencing.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Get over the fear of being judged</li>
          <p>GET OVER IT! Do you know people who are afraid of being judged are called? "Need to be jerked" people. They value other's placement of value on them whereas you are already damn good yourself.  I have a perfect counter for that. F*** them. And I know. . fear of sounding stupid right? Fear asking stupid questions? People who fear asking questions are robotic, meaning they can never think for themselves. They'll all work at Mc'Donalds and flippin' burgers whereas you will be well on your way to making BIG $$.</p>
        <li>Be the catalyzer</li>
          <p>If you have a question, there is a HIGH chance that OTHERS will have the same question. And guess what? Instead of being judged, you are now the leader amongst all the shrewds.</p>
        <li>Learn to ask again .. again and again EVEN IF IT WASTES TIME</li>
          <p>UNTIL YOU FINALLY UNDERSTAND! Grit and persistence will gain you the knowledge ('if you sincerely care, in which you should if you want to be of greatness'). How many times have you asked your teacher and the teacher just didn't quite answer what you initially asked. He/she beats around the questions and gives you a round-a-bout answer. Maybe because he/she doesn't know. BINGO! Here's the time where you can make your teacher sweat by keep asking questions until you understand.</p>
          <p>Secondly, you don't waste time. You only waste time if you end up not knowing how to do anything. You end up wasting your time. Imagine you were too afraid to ask questions on how to fry the french fries in the proper way. You end up burning them for one, and wasting more of your time and customer time for new french fries.</p>
        <li>Make it a habit</li>
          <p>When you ask questions, your mind is thinking outside the box. Creativity is also the art of asking questions. Get yourself into the habit of asking questions </p>
        <li>Frame detailed, goal oriented questions</li>
          <p>Avoid generalization. You will get a broad spectrum of possible answers, whereas you only were originally looking for "the one." For example, how do I make a spaghetti versus what is the step by step process to make meatball spaghetti from start to finish, including what ingredients to buy? Do you see the difference? The problem with the first framed question was, what kind of spaghetti do you want to make amongst other possible unclearness. Too much unclearness will not give you a proper answer.</p>
      </ol>
