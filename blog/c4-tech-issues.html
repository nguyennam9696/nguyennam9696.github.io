      <h2>The Problems with the Technology World</h2>
      <h3><b><i>"We're still in the first minutes of the first day of the Internet revolution."</i></b>   -   <i>Scott Cook</i></h3>
      <p>Technology has progressed and made much advancements and better mankind. Thank you Wright Brothers, Edison, Gate, Jobs, Pasteur. The list goes on and on. Efficiency, feasability, accessibility, and more is all created by technology to make humans be able to live better lives. As a tech nerd, I have nothing but gratitude towards all of my predecessors and genuis inventors/brave people that took so many risks to give us what we all have. Yes. Many people will bash the downside of technology more than thank technology or takes it for granted. However, I believe technology is innocent. It is human kind that sets a social value to technology that dirties the technological purpose.</p>
      <p>But this article is on flaws. Yes there are flaws despite technology being a part of human society's lifestyle of every day of every second. Thus, this can be a problem. The #1 problem is: Reliance. Nowadays, people are so reliant on technology to perform basic tasks that you can do on your own. Calculators to do basic arithmetic calculations. Googling something instead of going to a public library to pick up a book and read. Facebook in replacement of real world human interaction.</p>
      <p>We live in this technological world and yet still are not fulfilled. Mobile apps are have about a year to two year hype and then it begins to die off. I remember Angry Bird was so popular, and now it is replaced by games like Trivia Crack and Clash of Clans. The turnover rate of the technological world is so fast, that we constantly have to upgrade our Samsung Galaxy S4 that we got last year for a Samsung Galaxy S5 just for a tad bit faster processor. Why? Because technology became not a tool to help your daily use feasibility and consumption, but a fad to brag about that you are better than someone else that still holds a "chocolate phone nokia." We have lost touch with the genuine human side and have more excuses to become more superficial.</p>
      <h3>How I Would Bring About Change?</h3>
      <p>Humans are never satisfied and competitions are always there to bring about higher processor and chase after that American Dream. There is no solution to fixing the human nature side. We will always be infinitely curious and always strive for more or else we would become mindless technologies ourselves. PARADOX? I think so. My simple solution is to bring back the human interaction where people still knock on each other's door and invite them to go play soccer and play hide-n-go-seek. Too many times have we succumbed to text message as our 12 hour interaction with another human. Let's change that and bring back our human to human interaction side. Cut the middle man sometimes.</p>
      <p>It is not the technology, but the humans that are the problems to the technology world. I won't generalize this case to everybody. As long as you see that there is a problem. You are a good human in this technological world ;) Let's bring about change shall we? Post a comment below to let me know what you would do to change this problem.</p>
