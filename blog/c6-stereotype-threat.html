      <h2>4 Effective Solution to Break Free From Stereotype Threats:</h2>
      <p>Let's be honest here. With a raise of hands, who has been affected by stereotypes that hinders you or simply pisses you off? Cool, a whole lot of you. If you keep reading this blog, I will explain the 3 methods to find an exit to stereotype threats. But what can a stereotype threat be? This attack is on a person's mentality . . . negatively. It is where a thought can be overly adopted by the masses about specific types of individuals or certain ways of doing things. It may not be real, but once you believe it, it may negatively affect who you are.</p>
      <p>Let's check out a couple of examples. Asians are good at math. Alright. . . but how would this negatively affect someone. Would this really be the deciding factor for all of Asia to be in the Math related fields? In the programming world, is it the Indians and curly haired white guy dominated? People have been wondering if this actually deterred other types such as woman to go into the programming world. This is what we call stereotype threat.</p>
      <p>Be honest here. People like to go into places where they belong. Why apply for an engineering field if you are the only girl there and 100 guys would swarm and harrass you day and night? I believe the combination of 3 factors to combat stereotype is</p>
      <ul>
         <b>
          <li>1) Time</li>
          <li>2) Acceptance</li>
          <li>3) "Just-Do-It" <i>(if that's your passion)</i></li>
          <li>4) **Education**</li>
        </b>
      </ul>
      <p>These are my 4 effective solutions to break free form stereotype threats. Notice I did not say anything about go beat them up if they call you a "certain name-calling" based on your type. This is all based on your inner-growth to outgrow those little minded people. Believe me, you are much better than they are.</p>
      <p><em>Time, acceptance, "just-do-it", and education</em> are all intertwined. It is 2015. The people that are prejudice and still believe in "white-power," slavery, dictatorship, men are more powerful, no immigration, no gays, etc. the list goes on, but these people are becoming older and will die off soon. Now what happens, the people that are in this new era are all being educated. Branches of studies such as sociology, culture, woman-rights, social-movements and more are being offered at a young age. Education has been free in America. Awesome. There should not be an excuse where your kid is uneducated. The only people that are still stereotyping 1) are either joking around (and sometimes it is funny but that is due to an educated gesture) or 2) the one that outright believes what he is stating about you (these are the ones I avoid). Yes I admit, sometimes stereotypes are funny and they still exist; however, it is not so serious to me in terms of they were educated stereotypes and we have grown to "accept" it and "embraced" it. That is what I mean by acceptance. I am not so butthurt over the fact they call me small-eyed and small-penis. I commented back wittedly "these small eyes can micro-manage in Starcraft easier" and "small-penis can thrust faster than a big fat one." Once you can embraced stereotype, you have embraced a certain sense of culture about yourself rather than try to blend into the masses. Who are you really without knowing your predecessors, your culture and your roots?</p>
      <p>The media has a powerful play upon people and the media are steering towards a more open-minded outlook towards the "melting-pot" of America. Anybody can join any group they want. I remember when I played basketball with a bunch of tall black guys. I loved basketball, but I did not let the stereotype threaten my desire to ball-up some tall dudes. I've seen them a lot in the NBA . . . so what? If I suck compared to them so what? I love basketball. I'm not gonna let my thinking deter me from playing it. If a girl really likes mechanics. Go for mechanical engineering even if it is male dominated. Eventually when you lead by example. People will follow as well. It feels good to be the catalyst ;)</p>
      <p>So, overall my message is, next time when someone makes a dumb stereotype comment to you, counterback with your "educated" witty comment that makes them laugh. No need to argue with them, it will go nowhere versus show them how open-minded you are and "secretly" how much better you are than them. Because look, it is 2015. Get over it man.</p>
