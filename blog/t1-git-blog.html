      <h2>VCS, How Git Track Changes, and the Benefits of Github</h2>
      <h3>Version Control System</h3>
      <p>Git is known as your version control that controls/tracks the versions of your codes so that you can make changes to it later. This is much like saving a document from Microsoft Words but for codes. Version control system (VCS) allows you to revert the files to what it was previously, see who has modified it, compare changes, and more. Coders tend to make lots of mistakes; however, with VCS, coders can have an ease of mind because if coders accidentally screw up a week's worth of hard work, VCS makes it so any "versions" are very easily recoverable. In addition, VCS allows a team of coders to work on any file at any time instead of having to worry about if member "A" is finished adding the code yet. VCS allows for simultaneous collaboration on the same file. Gasp! Cool, I know.</p>
      <h3>How Git Track Changes</h3>
      <p>So, you may be wondering how this works. Well, it is very simple. Open your terminal or command line and change directory that contains your file. Simple punch in "git add ." and then git commit -m "your message." Git will save your version exactly the way you saved it to your local computer.</p>
      <h3>Benefits of Github</h3>
       <p>Github is a hub where coders can share/edit/collaborate their git repository. It is a cloud but for code files similar to Drop Box except the beauty of it is the collaboration/sharing part. What is neat is it can act as your portfolio/resume for when you apply for programmer jobs. The more git repositories, meaning the more project you have, the more impressed your future boss/friends/family will be. It is a place where you can find open source code that you can use for your own.</p>
