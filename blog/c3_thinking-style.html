      <h3>Nam's Progress</h3>
        <p>Growth mindset and hands-on learning/repetition. That is Nam. For the first 2 weeks, I was holding up. However, Ruby - 3rd Week is a bit tough for me. I feel like I haven't gulped down the information as well as I wished I had. I held down work as well as my studies to the best of my extent and I am happy. I probably placed the lowest quality but the most effort in DBC. DBC might look at me as someone who haven't worked as hard, but in fact, I placed as much effort in as I could with the time allotted.</p>
        <p>The change that I will make is to do less time at work, so I won't be exhausted by the time I come home.</p>
