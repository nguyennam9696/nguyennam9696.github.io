      <h2>Nam's Way of Thinking</h2>
      <h3>Gregorc Thinking Style</h3>
      <p>There are 4 thinking styles in a Gregorc thinking style: 1) Concrete Sequential  2) Abstract Sequential  3) Concrete Random  4) Abstract Random. For times sake, I want to just explain my type of thinking. In terms of programming, I would approach the "Concrete Sequential" way of thinking. I want to learn things in order, logical sequence, follow directions, having things structured, and to lay the hard foundation down first before I would jump into abstract ways of thinking. If I were to jump around and suddenly land on an advanced topic before I even learned the basics, I would be lost and waste a lot of my time. I learned this the hard way where I could not handle the coding challenges because I realized I was not creative enough with my coding because I haven't laid down my foundation yet.</p>
      <h3>Strategies For Adapting Learning Styles to Thinking Styles</h3>
      <p>I will not stress this enough about adaptation of theory into real practice is repetition and transition into weaving theories together into scenarios that it can be used for. It's all about laying the groundwork before you begin flying. People loves the excitement of flying so much that they skip all the laborous task that allows you the knowledge on how to soar up to the sky (metaphorically speaking). This requires discipline to sit and keep repeating via typing your codes over and over again until you understand why you code things. The creative/abstract work will come into play smoothly after.</p>
      <h3>Ways to expand ways to learn and think</h3>
      <p>Read more books. Authors and teachers teaching from different angles and perspectives for the same goal will help you solidify your knowledge. You know what they say, until your parents yell at you 3 or more times, you wouldn't really listen. There is the school that gives you homework and there is you that give yourself your own homework. Except sometimes your homework is more fun than the school's homework. This is the part where you can grow the most is if you enjoy what you are actually learning. Learning is an enjoyable process that requires a lot of neuronal fiber connections. That is where reading from different authors and learning from different teachers on Youtube would help a lot. It creates a lot more neuronal connections in your brain on one common subject than if you were to just learn something once and never repeat it again. This is the way to a growth mindset. Enjoy what you do. Because it is true, you only live once!</p>
