      Git is known as your version control that controls/tracks the versions of your codes so that you can make changes to it later. This is much like saving a document from Microsoft Words but for codes. Version control system (VCS) allows you to revert the files to what it was previously, see who has modified it, compare changes, and more. Coders tend to make lots of mistakes; however, with VCS, coders can have an ease of mind because if coders accidentally screw up a week's worth of hard work, VCS makes it so any "versions" are very easily recoverable. In addition, VCS allows a team of coders to work on any file at any time instead of having to worry about if member "A" is finished adding the code yet. VCS allows for simultaneous collaboration on the same file. Gasp! Cool, I know.
    </p>
    <p>
       So, you may be wondering how this works. Well, it is very simple. Open your terminal or command line and change directory that contains your file. Simple punch in "git add ." and then git commit -m "your message." Git will save your version exactly the way you saved it to your local computer.
    </p>
    <p>
        Github is a hub where coders can share/edit/collaborate their git repository. It is a cloud but for code files similar to Drop Box except the beauty of it is the collaboration/sharing part. What is neat is it can act as your portfolio/resume for when you apply for programmer jobs. The more git repositories, meaning the more project you have, the more impressed your future boss/friends/family will be. It is a place where you can find open source code that you can use for your own.

        Hey everyone! My name is Nam Nguyen. I went to medical school for 2 years and decided to drop out to embrace my natural element of entrepreneurship. However, we all know entrepreneurship needs to be a do-er rather than just all talk. So that is why I chose DBC.
    </p>
    <p>
        Having no background in computer programming does not scare me. However, other coding bootcamps that expects the students to go in with lots of background and succeeding in the initial challenges DOES scare me. DBC looks into the person more than the actual previous experience. Which is what I love. They begin from square 1, assuming you have no previous background, but is still able to maintain that challenging environment amongst learning the basics. I love it. Personally, I love the DBC experience. Because they focused on gathering the people that fits into the type of community, my cohort is a bunch of people that cannot stop socializing, helping each other out, and especially making my phone's notification ring every second. Google hangout became a "hangout."
    </p>
    <p>
        Coders are often looked as being introverts, in their own den, doing their own thing, wearing hoodies and an oversized headphone, but my own personal experience, my cohorts does have all of that except they are super fun. They posts links that are helpful with programming and respond to each other's cries during one another's struggles. If we are learning about terminal commands, I would post fun youtube links that would teach you how to hack wifi's using terminal commands. The DBC environment is better than I thought. I had a stigma where coders were not social and hard to get along with, but I was wrong. Total opposite. They are actually more down to earth and nerdier than medical students. Yes, I said it. Coders are fun and can be funny. I am very excited to be part of the DBC experience. It was nerve-wracking at first because I dropped out of medicine for this and I let my parents down, but now I feel more at ease. About 70% of the wonderful experience comes from the people that are struggling alongside with you.

    <h2>What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?</h2>
        <p>
        <img src="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/images/boxdim.png">
        </p>
        <p>Take for example Google's homepage. What you see right in front of you, the webpage, has 4 parts that make up the whole box of the webpage: margin, border, padding, and content. This is a CSS Box Model and all HTML elements are considered as boxes. CSS box modles wraps around the HTML elements so that these elements don't fly around randomly. The orderly format of the webpage is thanks to the CSS Box Model keeping all of your contents in place.</p>
        <p>The content you already know, it is the content of the page. Enough said about that. Margins wrap around the border. Border wraps around the padding and content. Padding wraps around the content. </p>
    <h2>What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?</h2>
        <p>Like your classroom, it has a lot of people. Thus naturally, class selectors for programming language is used on several elements. "id" selectors, similar to "I would" in English language has an "I" in there for a single person, so naturally "id" selectors are used for one element. If a certain style is used more than once, we should use classes. If a style is very specific, use id. </p>
    <h2>What are the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>You have to realize that there is a 4th, which is static positioning and that is the default.</li>
          <li>Relative positioning is misleading because what it actually means is "relative to itself." It would be static if there is no other positioning attributes such as setting top:10px, but if there were other positioning attributes, it would shift down 10px because it is relative to itself.</li>
          <li>Absolute positioning means it has to "absolutely" be at the position you want it to be. However, the only downside is that you may lose flexibility of your site if it's used improperly.</li>
          <li>Fixed positioning would help an element be positioned relative to where you are viewing on the website. For example, if you scroll down, it would scroll down with you.</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>What does it mean to display inline vs inline blocks?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Display:Inline</b>     Inline just displays within the line and no blocks which means that it ignores the block part, the width and height properties. In addition, since it is "in the line," it will ignore top and bottom margin settings and will adhere to left and right margins + padding settings. It is like a text box that flows after the other. Good to link up text box to text box.</li>
          <li><b>Display:Inline-Block</b>     Inline-block has both the inline and block feature. It is sequential, on their own line with text, but has width and height unlike it's counterpart "inline."</li>
        </ul>
