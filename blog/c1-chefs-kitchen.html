      <h2>The DBC Experience - An Ex-Med Student's Story</h2>
      <h3>Once Upon A Time . . . </h3>
      <p>There was a young boy named Nam Nguyen. I went to medical school for 2 years and decided to drop out to embrace my natural element of entrepreneurship. However, we all know entrepreneurship needs to be a do-er rather than just all talk. So that is why I chose DBC.</p>
      <h3>Venturing Onto the Unknown</h3>
      <p>Having no background in computer programming does not scare me. However, other coding bootcamps that expects the students to go in with lots of background and succeeding in the initial challenges DOES scare me. DBC looks into the person more than the actual previous experience. Which is what I love. They begin from square 1, assuming you have no previous background, but is still able to maintain that challenging environment amongst learning the basics. I love it. Personally, I love the DBC experience. Because they focused on gathering the people that fits into the type of community, my cohort is a bunch of people that cannot stop socializing, helping each other out, and especially making my phone's notification ring every second. Google hangout became a "hangout."</p>
      <h3>Realizing His True Passion</h3>
      <p>Coders are often looked as being introverts, in their own den, doing their own thing, wearing hoodies and an oversized headphone, but my own personal experience, my cohorts does have all of that except they are super fun. They posts links that are helpful with programming and respond to each other's cries during one another's struggles. If we are learning about terminal commands, I would post fun youtube links that would teach you how to hack wifi's using terminal commands. The DBC environment is better than I thought. I had a stigma where coders were not social and hard to get along with, but I was wrong. Total opposite. They are actually more down to earth and nerdier than medical students. Yes, I said it. Coders are fun and can be funny. I am very excited to be part of the DBC experience. It was nerve-wracking at first because I dropped out of medicine for this and I let my parents down, but now I feel more at ease. About 70% of the wonderful experience comes from the people that are struggling alongside with you.</p>
