      <h2>What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?</h2>

        <p>

        <p>
        Take for example Google's homepage. What you see right in front of you, the webpage, has 4 parts that make up the whole box of the webpage: margin, border, padding, and content. This is a CSS Box Model and all HTML elements are considered as boxes. CSS box modles wraps around the HTML elements so that these elements don't fly around randomly. The orderly format of the webpage is thanks to the CSS Box Model keeping all of your contents in place.
        </p>
        <p>The content you already know, it is the content of the page. Enough said about that. Margins wrap around the border. Border wraps around the padding and content. Padding wraps around the content. </p>

      <h2>What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?</h2>
        <p>Like your classroom, it has a lot of people. Thus naturally, class selectors for programming language is used on several elements. "id" selectors, similar to "I would" in English language has an "I" in there for a single person, so naturally "id" selectors are used for one element. If a certain style is used more than once, we should use classes. If a style is very specific, use id. </p>
      <h2>What are the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>You have to realize that there is a 4th, which is static positioning and that is the default.</li>
          <li>Relative positioning is misleading because what it actually means is "relative to itself." It would be static if there is no other positioning attributes such as setting top:10px, but if there were other positioning attributes, it would shift down 10px because it is relative to itself.</li>
          <li>Absolute positioning means it has to "absolutely" be at the position you want it to be. However, the only downside is that you may lose flexibility of your site if it's used improperly.</li>
          <li>Fixed positioning would help an element be positioned relative to where you are viewing on the website. For example, if you scroll down, it would scroll down with you.
      <h2>What does it mean to display inline vs inline blocks?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Display:Inline</b>     Inline just displays within the line and no blocks which means that it ignores the block part, the width and height properties. In addition, since it is "in the line," it will ignore top and bottom margin settings and will adhere to left and right margins + padding settings. It is like a text box that flows after the other. Good to link up text box to text box.</li>
          <li><b>Display:Inline-Block</b>     Inline-block has both the inline and block feature. It is sequential, on their own line with text, but has width and height unlike it's counterpart "inline."</li>
